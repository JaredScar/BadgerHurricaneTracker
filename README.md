# Badger Hurricane Tracker

## Features
You can see tropical storms on a map as well as data about them (such as 
wind speeds, storm pressure, and storm names). You can see the latest news 
about these storms at the `Home` page if maps don't really work for your 
device the best. (Still working on responsiveness...)

## Credits
